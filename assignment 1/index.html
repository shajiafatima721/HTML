    <p>Today marks the start of an exciting journey—I wrote my first lines of HTML (HyperText Markup Language)! If you’ve ever wondered how websites are created, HTML is the very first step. It’s the backbone of every webpage you see on the internet.</p>

    <p> (!DOCTYPE html) : Tells the browser this is an HTML5 document.</p>       
    <p> (html) : The root element of the page.</p>   
    <p>(head) : Contains meta information (like the title).</p>    
    <p>(body) : Contains the visible content.</p>    
    <p>(h1) : A heading.</p>    
    <p> (p) : A paragraph.(/p)</p>
