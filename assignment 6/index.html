    <h1>HTML form</h1>
    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
    <p>A <b>webform</b>, <b>web form</b> or <b>HTML</b> form on a web page allows a user to enter data that is sent to a server for processing. Forms can resemble paper or database forms because web users fill out the forms using checkboxes, radio buttons, or text fields. For example, forms can be used to enter shipping or credit card data to order a product, or can be used to retrieve search results from a search engine.</p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Forms are enclosed in the HTML <form> element. This HTML element specifies the communication endpoint the data entered into the form should be submitted to, and the method of submitting the data, GET or POST.</p>
    <strong>Elements</strong>
    <p>Forms can be made up of standard graphical user interface elements:</p>
    <p> â€” a button that can be tied to action such as submitting the form, resetting the form or executing a JavaScript function.</p>
